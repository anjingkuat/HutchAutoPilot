This is a summary of the autopilot project and a space where I will specify the functionality and the architecture.

I am planning on designing an autopilot for a fixed wing aircraft that is capable of the following functions:

	maintain a specified course and altitude
	gather, interpret and act upon weather updates from an airport, specifically barometric pressure/density altitude information
	navigate using GPS waypoints, by calculating and flying a specific path
	interpret a mission file that can be accessed via sd card
	communicate telemetry data to a ground station
	receive commands from a ground station
	move into and out of a hover condition
	return to home on a loss of signal
	
The autopilot will be able to communicate with the following sensors:

	3-axis gyroscope
	3-axis accelerometer
	3-axis magnetometer
	barometer
	GPS
	airspeed sensor
	Air Traffic Control (ATC)
	
These sensors will provide the autopilot with the following information:

	3 DOF orientation information (from the gyroscope and accelerometer)
	3 DOF motion information (from the accelerometer, GPS, barometer, airspeed sensor, and ATC)
	A vector to the magnetic north pole (from the magnetometer)
	Altitude above sea level (ASL)(from the GPS and barometer)
	Altitude above ground level (AGL) (from the barometer, ATC, and any topographical map info available)
	Location on the Earth's surface (GPS and dead reckoning from imu)
	
The general sequence of events will go something like this:

	acquire sensor data
	determine desired state
	determine current state
